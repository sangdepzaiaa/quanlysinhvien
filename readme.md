# Student Management System

This is my first-year project from LaGuardia Community College, demonstrating my knowledge of C++ basics. The Student Management System is a console-based application designed to manage student records. It allows users to insert, view, search, delete, update, sort, and display statistics of student information.

## Features

- Insert Student record
- View All Student records
- Search Student record by ID
- Search Student record by Name
- Delete Student record
- Update Student record
- Sort Students by Name
- Display Statistics
